# Key Takeaways

I discovered that there are specialized functions called hooks designed for this purpose.\
These hooks include useState, useEffect, and useRef, which empower developers to seamlessly manage states and\ the lifecycle of their applications.\

I used useState to dynamically update the counter variable.\
useEffect to automatically adjust the document title whenever the counter underwent a change.\
useRef to capture the button element and dynamically modify its background color upon being clicked.\
